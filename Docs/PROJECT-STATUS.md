## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **Limited Locale Support** - Only 14 common locales (out of 500+ in CLDR)
   - Future: Add dynamic import support for all locales
2. **Bundle Size** - 290.83KB gzipped (within target but could be smaller)
   - Future: Implement code splitting per demo page
3. **Calendar Support** - Dates demo only supports Gregorian calendar
   - CLDR includes Chinese, Hebrew, Islamic, and other calendars
   - Future: Add calendar selector UI
4. **Skeleton Pattern Coverage** - ~50 of ~65 available formats work (77%)
   - Quarter fields (Q, q) and Week fields (w, W) not supported by Intl
   - These require custom calendar calculations
   - Unsupported patterns automatically filtered from UI
5. **No Offline Support** - Requires internet for XML fetching
   - Future: Add Service Worker with caching
6. **No Mobile Testing** - Not extensively tested on mobile devices
   - Future: Test on real devices and optimize

### Dependencies to Watch
- `cldr-*` packages at v48.0.0 (check for updates quarterly)
- React 18 (monitor for React 19 release)
- Vite 6 (keep up to date with latest)

## Questions & Decisions Needed

### Open Questions
1. Should we support IE11? (Current answer: No, ES2020+ only)
2. Which analytics service to use? (Privacy-friendly options: Plausible, Fathom)
3. Custom domain name? (TBD)
4. Should we add a blog section? (Future consideration)

### Recent Decisions
- ✅ Use native Intl.DateTimeFormat over external libraries (2026-01-17)
  - Investigated ICU4X and @formatjs thoroughly
  - Discovered native Intl supports flexible day periods ('B' field)
  - Achieved 32.5 KB bundle size reduction
  - Zero external dependencies for date formatting
- ✅ Use static imports over dynamic imports (reliability over bundle size)
- ✅ Use Vitest over Jest (faster, better Vite integration)
- ✅ Keep documentation in Docs/ folder (better organization)
- ✅ Use TanStack Query for caching (industry standard)
- ✅ Context-aware XML extraction (accuracy over simplicity)
